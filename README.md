STATUS (as of Feb 28, 2017)

    Since this project just started, there are plenty of easy stuff to do!

    Currently, needs work on functionality such as manipulating colors.
    
    (Especially if you know HTML/CSS/JS)

Website:
- basic website
- slideshow to present features
- download counter
- about, releases, terms and privacy pages

Key functionality: 
- html color picker (box and hexagon)
- adjustments: tones brightness(tints shades) hues saturation
- generated palattes based on selected color
- harmonies (complementary, triadic, tetradic, analogous, analogous, custom)
- easy import/export of many many colors

Additional functionality:
- responsive design
- drag and drop colors
- click to copy color
- color opacity support
- rearrange workspace
- ability to remove colors easily

Desktop functionality:
- cross platform (built with electron)
- stay on top
- key shorcuts: esc, undo, delete, etc.
- automatic updates
- save user data (options, colors from previous session)
- show on tray
- eyedropper to get color of anything
- screenshot (also to get colors/palatte)

Possible/Experimental Features:
- additional add-ons
- palattes/colors shared by other users
- accounts, saving on cloud
- integration with other apps

Things to fix currently:
- this README.md (better description/ formatting/ adding screenshots perhaps)
- fix hexagon color selection (front-end)
- possibly better text input to color conversion
- download all assets and make offline (fonts, scripts)
- which license ?
- eventually package for testing (should be standalone executable without installation)
