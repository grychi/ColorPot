STATUS (as of Feb 18, 2017)

    Since this project just started, there are plenty of easy stuff to do!

    Currently, needs work on functionality such as manipulating colors.

- slideshow to present features
- download counter
- about, releases, terms and privacy pages

Key functionality: 
- html color picker (box and hexagon)
- adjustments: tones brightness(tints shades) hues saturation
- generated palattes based on selected color
- harmonies (COMPLEMENTARY, TRIADIC, TETRADIC, ANALOGOUS, ANALOGOUS, custom)
- easy import/export of many many colors

Additional functionality:
- responsive design
- drag and drop colors
- click to copy color
- color opacity support
- rearrange workspace
- ability to remove colors easily

Desktop functionality:
- cross platform (built with electron)
- stay on top
- key shorcuts: esc, undo, delete, etc.
- automatic updates
- save user data (options, colors from previous session)
- show on tray

Things to fix currently:
- this README.md (better description/ formatting/ adding screenshots perhaps)
- better text input to color conversion
- google font used, download and make offline

- eventually package for testing

Possible/Experimental Features:
- additional add-ons
- palattes/colors shared by other users
